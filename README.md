This project aims to provide a simple, yet effective solution for managing issues, with functionalities like submitting issues, updating their status, and viewing a list of issues.

This project uses the following technologies:

Frontend: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
Backend: Node.js (Express), Axios for API requests
Database: MongoDB (or you can specify if you're using a different DB)

Features

View Issues: A list of issues is displayed with essential information like title, description, status, and creation date.
Responsive: Works seamlessly across various screen sizes from mobile devices to desktops.
Error Handling: Proper error messages for when something goes wrong, like failed requests.





This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
